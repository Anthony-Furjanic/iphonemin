    <h1>how to make changes</h1>

  <main>
    <h2>Welcome to the How-To section of the admin version of the Corp Mobility Simulator site! if you are here you are you are looking to make changes to the site.  A few key things to remember...

<br>
<br>
<br>
        First and foremost, dont be nervous. As long as you follow the Golden rule and dont make any changes to the master template , everything is reversible!
        
        (even if you do make a change to the master copy its still reversible in most if not all cases, but as good practice you want to avoid this if possible)
        
<br>
<br>
<br>   
         If you do make any changes that cause an unintended change to the site ,  vs code holds a localized timeline of recent saves to the project so you can always expand the timeline and go to a recent version before you made the change (see how to section "how to revert to a previous save in the project")
        
<br>
<br>
<br>
         Anything you see in green text is commentation on the code and not part of the code itself , I have notated code that is crucial to the inner workings of the application with  the notation at the top of the code ***CRUCIAL APPLICATION STRUCTURE, NOT RECCOMENDED TO MAKE ANY CHANGES*** and at the end of that section you will see the notation ***END OF CRUCIAL STRUCTURE SECTION***
<br>
    
        
         This means that the code plays a crucial role in the inner workings of the application, it should not be changed by anyone unless they have at least a high end novice to Low end intermediate knowledge of HTML,CSS, and Javascript
<br>
<br>
<br>
        
        On the flipside of that , there are sections of code that are able to be simply changed by design and require little to no coding knowledge to edit. They have clearly listed How-to instructions in the sections below and can be edited with zero or near zero effects to the inner workings of the application.

  var emailAddress = 'recipient@example.com';

  // Replace 'Subject' and 'Body' with your desired email subject and body
  var emailSubject = 'Your Custom Subject';
  var emailBody = 'Your Custom Body';

  // Construct the mailto URL
  var mailtoURL = 'mailto:' + emailAddress + '?subject=' + encodeURIComponent(emailSubject) + '&body=' + encodeURIComponent(emailBody);

  // Open the default email client
